      "subheading": "A conversation with Min Chen",
      "q1": "Why did you decide to partner with Buddy Bites?",
      "a1": "\"I’ve always had a deep love for dogs, and being able to give back to them in a meaningful way has been something close to my heart. That’s why I’m so grateful for the chance to partner with Buddy Bites — a brand that not only offers high-quality, nutritious food, but also puts compassion at the center of everything they do. For every 2kg of food sold, 1kg is donated to shelters in need. That kind of generosity truly moved me. It’s not just about feeding dogs — it’s about giving them a better life. I’m so proud to be part of a mission that’s helping dogs feel seen, cared for, and loved.\"",
      "q2": "What do you love most about Buddy Bites products?",
      "a2": "\"「Honestly? It’s like giving a belly rub to dogs you’ve never even met! I love that Buddy Bites makes doing good feel so simple — you buy a bag of yummy, high-quality food, and just like that, a shelter dog gets a full bowl too. The kibble itself is top-notch (vet-approved and made with ingredients I can actually pronounce!), but it’s the mission that makes it extra special. It feels like being part of a little secret dog-loving club that’s doing big things\"",
      "q3": "Tell us about your own dog(s)!",
      "a3": "\"I currently have a dog named Blue. I named her Blue because of her beautiful blue eyes; I called her that the first time I met her. Our family has shared ten wonderful years with Blue. She is a particularly gentle and adorable little companion. Every time she sits down, her paws are always crossed, and she loves to smile at us. She is our very best friend! Watching her thrive reminds me how much joy and comfort dogs bring into our lives — they deserve the very best care in return.\"",
      "q4": "Why do you think Buddy Bites stands out?",
      "a4": "\"Buddy Bites stands out because it's a brand with both heart and science behind it. It’s rare to find a company that prioritizes nutritional excellence while also committing so strongly to social good. Their support of over 15 shelters in Hong Kong and Singapore, providing consistent and nutritious food for rescue dogs, really sets them apart. It’s not just about selling dog food — it’s about building a better future for all dogs.\"",
      "q5": "What values do you share with Buddy Bites?",
      "a5": "\"We both believe that every dog, no matter where they are — in a loving home or in a shelter — deserves consistent, healthy food and proper care. I also resonate deeply with the idea of using everyday choices to create meaningful impact. Choosing a dog food brand like Buddy Bites means you’re not only nourishing your own dog, but also helping to ease the burden on shelters and give more dogs a better chance at life.\"",
      "q6": "What message would you like to share with other pet parents?",
      "a6": "\"To all the pet parents out there: feeding your dog with love can now also mean feeding another dog in need. By choosing Buddy Bites, you’re making a positive difference every day — and your dog gets to enjoy top-quality meals made with care. It’s a simple switch with a powerful ripple effect. I’m proud to be part of this journey with Buddy Bites, and I hope you’ll join us in spreading kindness, one bowl at a time.\""

We knew first hand the challenge of getting truly good quality dog food, consistently. We also knew the challenges that dog shelters go through. So, we created Buddy Bites to fix both these issues...To ensure Nacho and Nala (Chris' dogs) could eat food their guts deserve, whilst feeding their friends in shelters with every order. As to why you are reading it, we are not sure, but we certainly hope it's because you have a dog, and even more so that you're going to join the many pups moving to Buddy Bites!",
