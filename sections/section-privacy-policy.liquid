      <strong>Information we collect</strong>
      <p>
        We collect information from you when you purchase a membership and other services from us. The information we
        collect includes personally identifiable information, such as your name, home address, telephone number and
        email address. You may also provide non-personally identifiable information — for example, demographic
        information such as gender and date of birth, or the name of your employer or school.
      </p>
      <p>The information we collect may include the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Name</li>
        <li>Telephone number</li>
        <li>Email address</li>
      </ul>

      <strong>How we use your information</strong>
      <p>We use your personally identifiable information to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide services and products to you</li>
        <li>Contact you regarding services, and other administrative information</li>
        <li>Respond to your enquiries and comments</li>
        <li>
          Provide advertisements, newsletters, and/or other marketing or promotional and other information to you
          regarding products and services that we provide or otherwise offer for sale
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Our Business Purposes: We may use your information for our business purposes, such as data analysis, audits,
        fraud monitoring and prevention, developing new products and services, enhancing, improving or modifying our
        services, identifying usage trends, determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns and operating and
        expanding our business activities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other Purposes: We may use non-personally identifiable information for any purpose, except where we are required
        to do otherwise under applicable law. In some instances, we may combine non-personally identifiable information
        with personally identifiable information (such as associating your name with your employer if you are a
        participant in a corporate sponsored program), in which case we will treat the combined information as
        personally identifiable information as long as it is combined.

        Legal Requests or Requirements and to Prevent Harm: We reserve the right to disclose your personally
        identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our
        rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on Buddy Bites. We may
        also share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to prevent fraud or other illegal
        activity, to prevent imminent bodily harm, or to prevent harm to Buddy Bites, our members or other individuals.
        This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, courts or other government entities.
      </p>
      <p>

        changes or we otherwise transfer assets relating to our business to a third party, we may transfer your
        personally identifiable information to the new owner to be used as consistent with this policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Corporate and Insurance Programs: If you have a corporate employer sponsored or health insurance sponsored
        membership, upon the request of your employer or insurance provider, as applicable, we may share usage
